# About Us  
Heyyy my name is Tyler Norris, I am I CS major at ASU aka Alabny State Unaverity and I like the color blue. When you have some free times look up the name ShyGuyTyz.

Hello, my name is JeDonovan Kyle Otey, and I also am a CS major at Albany State University. 
My hobbies include listening to new music, gaming, and coding in my spare time. 
Coincidentally, my favorite color is blue as well...
